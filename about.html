        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Passion and Proffession are the two sides of the same coin. If coding is both your Proffession and Passion,
            that's me_Farha Elachola. I am a Certified Front End Developer(Udemy) working on several projects based on <b>HTML,CSS and Javascript.</b>
            I have completed my Bachelor of Technology Degree in Information Technology(CGPA of 7.6). Academic Projects included
            Text to Speech Convertor, using Matlab and an NFC based "Security Enhanced Express Delivery System", using Javascript 
            and MySql. During our course, I was also able to gain ample knowledge in <b>C,C#,Perl and Shell.</b> 
          <p>
            <p>Being the General Secretary of College Union was just the beginning of being a succesful <b>Team player</b>. As a Technical
                Assistant at KIPIC Kuwait, I was able to achieve <b>proficiency in Team Management, Organization and Time Management</b>.
                Moreover, I was also able to communicate with different departments of various language and culture
                making sure the workflow was balanced. Being a freelance poster maker has made me flexible with the ability to take direction, 
                work independently and set creative priorities.

            </p>
            
            <p>I believe my skills and web developing capabilities will make a significant contribution to your company's
                strengths. I am grateful to you for the time in reviewing my website. </p>
                <p>
                Hoping to hear from you soon.
                </p>
